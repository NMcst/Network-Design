# Network-Design


## Project Overview
In this project I collaborated with a team of 4 and developed a network topology in Cisco Packet Tracer.

## Topology
The topology that we came up with was a hybrid topology. It is a network structure that combines two or more different types of topology. In our case it is a combination of series of star topologies with an incorporation of a bus topology.

For this project I was responsible for applying firewalls and extended ACLs to all routers in the network. The goal was the IT Room router can ping all the different department routers and the department routers can only ping IT Room router. Here is a snippet of commands I used.

I also configured and encrpyted the AAA/RAIDUS authentication server. All the username and password are stored in this server so that is why encrypted the server and only authorized personnel can access the server for configuration.

In testing the network connectivity of each device we used troubleshooting commands such as ipconfig, netstat, ping, tracert, nslookup, & etc.
